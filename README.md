<h4><b> -------- INDEX --------</b></h4>
<h5> Homeworks : </h5>
<ol>

1. <b>[Homework 1 : Word Ladder](Homework%201%20-%20Word%20Ladder)</b>
   <p>Implementing word ladder in python. </p>
   <p>Objective : While changing only one letter each turn find the path 
   (list of words) it will take to reach from source word 's' to target word 
   't'. Demonstrate the understanding of the shortest path algorithms.</p>
   <br>
2. <b>[Homework 2 : Family Tree queries using Prolog](Homework%202%20-%20Family%20Tree%20queries%20using%20Prolog)</b>
    <p>Given the family tree in CSCI_630_Homework_2P_Writeup, complete the 
   script hw2.prolog to demonstrate the understanding of writing queries 
   using Prolog.</p>
   <br>
3. <b>[Homework 3 : Prework for Decision Tree & Adaboost](Homework%203%20-%20%20Prework%20for%20Decision%20trees%20&%20Adaboost)</b> 
   <p>Introduction to Decision trees and Adaboost. <br>NOTE : This homework 
   is not a complete implementation of decision trees and adaboost but just 
   a first level introduction. The concepts are explored more in depth in 
   Lab 3.</p>
</ol>

<h5> Labs : </h5>
<p>Each Lab has an associated write-up to give information about implementation 
instructions from the class instructor. A README file specific to the lab 
will give implementation instructions. A report will give any additional 
metrics/implementation notes if available.</p>
<ol>

1. <b>[Lab 1 : Summer Orienteering](Lab%201%20-%20Summer%20Orienteering)</b>
   <p>Implementation of the A* algorithm to chart a shortest path between 
   the waypoints of an Orienteering track for a given terrain.
   </p>

2. <b>[Lab 2 : FOL Resolution](Lab%202%20-%20FOL%20Resolution)</b>
   <p>
   Implementing a First Order Logic resolver that takes input as a CNF 
   clause and outputs yes/no depending on if the clause can be resolved.
   </p>

</ol>

NOTE - The assignments are implemented to gain understanding of a 
concept. While attention has been given to complexity and cleanliness of 
the code it may not be efficient and further adjustments can be made.
